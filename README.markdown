# RavenOverflow

### Introduction

This is a sample ASP.NET MVC3 application that leverages [RavenDB](Http://RavenDB.net) as the database / persistence store.

I've 100% copied [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow)'s home page, include css and images.

Like [Racoon Blog](https://github.com/ayende/RaccoonBlog) (another sample application which is actually being used in production scenarios), this project is trying to show the benefits of RavenDb in an ASP.NET MVC3 framework.

### What it Does

* List some fake questions. Summarize answers / views / tags.

### What it Uses

* RavenDb
* ASP.NET MVC3 
* Structure for IoC
* NBuilder for fake data
* An attempt to simulate a production solution layout (eg. n-Tier, IoC, etc)

### What it is NOT

* A best practice application. I'm a noob, so this is a learning experience.
